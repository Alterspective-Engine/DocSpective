# Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Template

A comprehensive template repository that implements Spec-Driven Development workflows with automated GitHub repository setup, property management, and AI agent integration.

## What is Spec-Driven Development (SDD)?

Spec-Driven Development is a methodology where software development is guided by clear, executable specifications that serve as the single source of truth for project requirements, behaviors, and implementations.

### Core Principles

- **Specification First**: Before any code is written, create detailed specifications that define exactly what needs to be built
- **Executable Documentation**: Specifications are not just documentation - they drive automated testing, validation, and development workflows  
- **AI Agent Integration**: AI coding agents use specifications as their primary instruction set for autonomous development
- **Traceability**: Every feature implementation can be traced back to its originating specification
- **Consistency**: All team members and AI agents work from the same authoritative source of truth

## Why Use SDD?

### Traditional Development Challenges
- Requirements often change or get misunderstood during development
- Documentation becomes outdated and unreliable
- Team members have different interpretations of what to build
- Code reviews focus on implementation details rather than requirement fulfillment
- AI agents receive inconsistent or incomplete instructions

### SDD Solutions
- **Clarity**: Specifications provide unambiguous requirements that humans and AI agents can follow
- **Efficiency**: AI agents can autonomously implement features based on clear specifications
- **Quality**: Automated validation ensures implementations match specifications exactly
- **Maintainability**: Changes flow from specs to implementation, keeping everything synchronized
- **Collaboration**: Teams collaborate on specifications before costly implementation begins

## How SDD Works

### Repository Types

**Specification Repositories (`role: spec`)**
- Contain detailed feature specifications, requirements, and behavioral definitions
- Serve as the authoritative source of truth for what needs to be built
- Include acceptance criteria, test scenarios, and validation rules
- Used by AI agents as instruction sets for autonomous development

**Feature Repositories (`role: feature`)**  
- Implement the features defined in specification repositories
- Reference their parent specification repository via the `spec` property
- Contain actual code, tests, and implementation artifacts
- Automatically validated against their parent specifications

### Workflow Overview

1. **Specification Creation**: Teams create detailed specifications in spec repositories
2. **Feature Repository Generation**: New feature repositories are created from this template
3. **Automatic Configuration**: Repositories are automatically configured with appropriate properties
4. **AI Agent Development**: AI agents read specifications and autonomously implement features
5. **Validation & Integration**: Implementations are automatically validated against specifications

## Template Features

- ü§ñ **Automated Setup**: GitHub Actions workflow that automatically configures repository properties
- üîß **CLI Tools**: Scripts for GitHub authentication and organization setup  
- üìã **Custom Properties**: Automated management of SDD-specific repository metadata
- üîÑ **Template Integration**: Smart detection of template repository relationships
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security**: Proper authentication handling with comprehensive scopes
- üéØ **AI Ready**: Designed for seamless AI agent integration and autonomous development

## Quick Start

1. **Use this template** to create a new repository
2. The repository will be automatically configured with SDD properties on first push
3. Start developing according to SDD principles

For detailed setup instructions, see [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md).

## Custom Properties

This template automatically configures three custom repository properties that enable the SDD workflow:

### role
- **Type**: Single select (spec | feature)
- **Description**: Defines the repository's role in the SDD workflow
- **Required**: No
- **Values**:
  - `spec`: Repository contains specifications, requirements, and behavioral definitions
  - `feature`: Repository implements features based on specifications from a parent spec repository

### spec  
- **Type**: String
- **Description**: Links feature repositories to their governing specification repository
- **Required**: No
- **Usage**:
  - **Spec repositories**: Leave null/empty (they ARE the specification)
  - **Feature repositories**: Full repository slug of the parent spec (e.g., `your-org/product-spec`)

### instructions
- **Type**: String  
- **Description**: Points to the template repository containing SDD methodology, documentation, and AI agent instructions
- **Required**: No
- **Usage**: Automatically set to the template repository used to create this repo (this repository serves as the instruction source)
- **Purpose**: AI agents use this to locate their behavioral instructions, development guidelines, and SDD workflow definitions

## Repository Examples

### Specification Repository
- **Name**: `user-authentication-spec`
- **Properties**: `role=spec`, `spec=null`, `instructions=YOUR_ORG/sdd-template`
- **Contains**: User stories, API specifications, security requirements, test scenarios
- **Purpose**: Define exactly how user authentication should work

### Feature Repository  
- **Name**: `user-authentication-service`
- **Properties**: `role=feature`, `spec=YOUR_ORG/user-authentication-spec`, `instructions=YOUR_ORG/sdd-template`
- **Contains**: Implementation code, tests, deployment configurations
- **Purpose**: Implement the authentication service according to its specification

## AI Agent Integration

This template repository serves as the **instruction source** for AI agents working within the SDD workflow. The `instructions` property in every generated repository points back to this template, enabling AI agents to:

### Access SDD Guidelines
- **Location**: `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- **Purpose**: Defines how AI agents should operate within SDD workflows
- **Scope**: Spec-first development, validation protocols, interaction patterns

### Understand Repository Context
- **Property Reading**: AI agents can read the `role`, `spec`, and `instructions` properties to understand their context
- **Spec Repository Access**: For feature repos, agents can locate and read the governing specification
- **Template Reference**: The `instructions` property provides the source for methodology and guidelines

### Follow SDD Protocols
- **Specification First**: Never implement without an approved specification
- **Traceability**: Every change must reference specification requirements  
- **Validation**: Automated verification that implementations match specifications
- **Incremental Development**: Small, reviewable changes with continuous validation

### Example AI Agent Workflow
1. **Repository Analysis**: Read properties to understand repository role and context
2. **Specification Loading**: If `role=feature`, load specification from `spec` property repository  
3. **Instruction Retrieval**: Access SDD guidelines from the `instructions` repository
4. **Implementation**: Follow spec-driven development protocols for all changes
5. **Validation**: Verify implementations against specifications before completion
